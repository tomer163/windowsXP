    <p class="paragraph">Hi, my name is <b style="color:rgb(21, 126, 0);">Tomer Saada</b>.<br><br> I took the challange to make a website that could mimic the look of windows xp in the browser. <br><br>
        I was able to do that using Vue.js and some scss, so all you're seeing here (accept for the background) is using html and css <b>ONLY.</b> <br><br>
        By now there is not much functionality since this is just a design project although you can drag this window if you'd like to.
